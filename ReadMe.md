# Physics Simulation

This is a project were I try to understand Direct X Api and build a better understanding 
of linear algebra and physics.

- [ ] Profiler


## DEV 
**OBJECTIVES**
- [ ] Implement Easy lines
- [ ] Implement Text Rendering
- [ ] Introspection
- [ ] IM GUI
- [ ] Implement Pixel to Unit Conversion
- [ ] QuadTree Implementation(Blah implementation).
- [ ] QuadTree Hilbert sequentialization.
- [ ] Implement a camera system.
- [ ] Font rendering.
- [ ] Get app timing correct
- [ ] Fix entity bugs on screen resize
- [ ] Write a profiler


**IMPLEMENTED**
- [x] Rotatate entity to match vel vector direction (TESTING?)
- [x] Hotswapable shader code
- [x] Hotswapables sim code
- [x] More Entities
- [x] Implende simple collisiont detection
- [x] Wall genaration & and enclose window with walls instead checkin pos agains centered window half dim [DONE!]
- [x] Make entities colide with each other
