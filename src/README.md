**NOTE(MIGUEL): (04/08/2022)**
I want to implement a quad tree but theres a few quesetions that i dont know.
Forexamle this is a spatial query so what units should i choose for it? Meters no?
There renderer should a be in charge of conversion to pixels... So the what are the
funtios supposed to do exactly. Ill read about it. What will be the starting grid size be?
I want to see the quad tree work with few entites a so relativelly about the half the size of the 
monitor with a low (about 2) entity cap per grid.
